Prompt injection is still breaking production LLM apps.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
System prompts aren’t enough. You need a security layer outside the model.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
TrustLayer is an API firewall for LLMs: prompt injection blocking, drift detection, and a kill switch.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here’s a live scan. The malicious prompt is blocked before it reaches the model.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can also run contract tests that bundle multiple safety checks in one call.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Drift detection alerts you when agents silently change behavior over time.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:25,000
During incidents, the kill switch locks down medium and high risk traffic instantly.
